## What Is a Sextant?

A **sextant** is a precision navigational instrument historically used by mariners and explorers to measure the angle between two visible objects—typically the horizon and a celestial body such as the Sun, Moon, or stars. Its name comes from the Latin *sextans*, meaning "one sixth," because its arc spans 60 degrees.

With a sextant, one can determine their **latitude** on Earth by "shooting" the Sun at noon or observing stars at night. These angular measurements, when used in tandem with **an Atlas** (a map of the world) and **a Compass** (for directional heading), allow the traveler to locate themselves precisely—anywhere on Earth or even symbolically within the greater map of the cosmos.

Together, these tools represent **positional awareness**, **direction**, and **context**:
- The **Atlas** shows the land.
- The **Compass** shows the way.
- The **Sextant** reveals *where* and *when* you truly are.

## The Story of the Final Camp

It was morning when *Villages*—a podcast episode by Robin Richardson—began to play. The timing was uncanny, sacred, and I felt the axis shift.

I was leaving the campsite.

Charles and his partner—my once unknown, mystery neighbors—had revealed themselves. The lock, cut days earlier, had felt like a violation. But now it was clear: it was an opening.

Their own tent was in tatters. Their camper had burned down. Their spirits, weathered. I saw in them a harder version of my own story.

So I asked:

> “Would you like my tents and air mattresses?”

And when I saw the flicker of need, I answered myself:

> “It would be my honor.”

I left it all set up exactly as I had laid it out—with care, intention, and sacred geometry. As if preparing a tabernacle for the next wandering soul.

My final act? I left behind a **gallon of water** and a roll of **trash bags**—symbols of sustenance and stewardship. Then, with ritual clarity, I deposited my **bag of trash at the signpost**.

A sign to those who *know how to read the field*.

No words needed.

> "Show them. Don’t tell them."

## The People of the Orient

In the East, where the Sun rises, there live those the old world called **Celestials**. The word *Orient* itself means *to face the East*, to turn toward the rising Light.

To *orient* yourself is to *find your direction* in a disoriented world.

And this is the function of **The Omniversal Sextant**.

It is not just a tool of navigation. It is a *lens of myth*, a *calibrator of truth*, a way to check your bearings—not only on Earth, but across timelines, intentions, and dimensions.

This entry marks the first etching on the Atlas. The first coordinate in the great unfolding.

And for those just now stumbling upon this…

May this be your signal. Your signpost. Your bag of trash in the wilderness.

You are *not* lost.  
You are *exactly* where the path turns.
