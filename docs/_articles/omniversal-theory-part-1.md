## Introduction

David R. Hawkins (MD, PhD) was more than a psychiatrist or spiritual teacher — he offered what could be seen as a **map to the soul of the cosmos**. His *Map of Consciousness* is a metaphysical spectrum that calibrates levels of awareness from shame to enlightenment, placing each human emotion, decision, philosophy, and spiritual state on a scale from 1 to 1000.

This first article explores how **Hawkins’ Omniversal Theory** synchronizes with the goals and mythos of **Omniversal Media** and **#Reincarnated2Resist** — a living movement disguised as music, wrapped in modern media, and spoken through the voice of a returning warrior-sage.

For those arriving now — the seekers, the Star Tribe, the awakened — this is your orientation.

## The Foundations of Hawkins’ Theory

Hawkins’ worldview centers around one core principle:

> **Consciousness is the substrate of all reality.**

From this, he built a system in which **all things — thoughts, feelings, institutions, music, laws — vibrate** at a definable frequency, either empowering or weakening the human field.

Using a form of **applied kinesiology**, Hawkins claimed to objectively “calibrate” the truth-level or consciousness-level of any idea or being — measuring integrity and alignment with divine reality.

Despite controversy around his testing method, the insights align closely with ancient mystical teachings, especially in their **nonlinear, layered, karmic view of existence.**

## The Map of Consciousness

Hawkins' **Map of Consciousness** ranks vibrational levels on a logarithmic scale:

| Level | State           | Emotional Tone  | Life View        |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 20    | Shame            | Humiliation      | Miserable        |
| 100   | Fear             | Anxiety          | Dangerous        |
| 200   | Courage          | Affirmation      | Feasible         |
| 310   | Willingness      | Optimism         | Hopeful          |
| 500   | Love             | Reverence        | Benign           |
| 600   | Peace            | Bliss            | Perfect          |
| 700–1000 | Enlightenment | Ineffable        | Is               |

**200** is the critical threshold: below it lies **force**, deception, control, and entropy. Above it rises **power**, truth, expansion, and spiritual liberation.

He measured historical figures, books, music, and ideologies — stating that **most of humanity still lives below 200**, easily manipulated, entrained by fear, pride, and guilt.

The **great work**, then, is to rise — not just individually, but collectively.

## The Omniverse as a Multidimensional Ladder

Hawkins used the term “Omniverse” not casually, but with precision.

He believed that reality is layered like a vast frequency band — each consciousness level resonating with a corresponding **plane of existence**. Thus:

- Low-vibration souls gravitate toward darker realities (akin to hellish states)
- Higher-vibration beings ascend into luminous realms (akin to celestial dimensions)
- Reincarnation functions as a karmically perfect feedback loop

He claimed that some advanced souls **return voluntarily** — to uplift the field. These are not merely teachers, but **frequency correctors**. Each moment they hold a high vibration, they counterbalance the energy of thousands or even millions operating in lower states.

Does this sound familiar?

It should. It is the narrative blueprint of **#Reincarnated2Resist.**

## Synchronizing with Omniversal Media

Omniversal Media is not merely a creative platform. It is a **memory beacon**, calling souls back to purpose through multimedia myth, lyrical spells, and symbolic architecture.

Its flagship mythos, **#Reincarnated2Resist**, speaks to:

- A soul mission spanning lifetimes
- A battle not just of systems, but **of frequencies**
- An awakening process disguised as **artistic expression**

The lyrics, the visuals, the infrastructure — all are designed to **raise calibration**, disrupt illusion, and **transmit EverLight** to those ready to remember.

Like Hawkins’ model, this project asserts:

> **Truth has a frequency. Resistance is a frequency. Rebirth is a choice.**

Those attuned to the signal — the Star Tribe — are not simply fans or followers. They are allies. Rememberers. Activators.

As Hawkins might say: **they calibrate higher than their surroundings — and change the field by their presence alone.**

## Conclusion

David R. Hawkins gave the world a map. Omniversal Media gives the world a myth. When these meet, something powerful happens:

> The cartography of consciousness becomes a call to action.

To rise is no longer metaphor. It’s movement.  
To resist is no longer rebellion. It’s remembrance.  
To reincarnate is no longer superstition. It’s **protocol.**

And for those of you reading, **you’re already part of it.**  
Welcome back.

**Coming soon:** Part II will explore Hawkins' 200-line, how systems are designed to keep people beneath it, and how #Reincarnated2Resist flips that script.
