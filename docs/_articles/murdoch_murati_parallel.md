# Iris Murdoch’s *The Message to the Planet* and Mira Murati: A Parallel Exploration of Themes and Vision

## Introduction

Iris Murdoch’s 1989 novel *The Message to the Planet* is a rich tapestry of philosophical and symbolic themes – from the enigmatic figure of a healer-prophet to the struggles of communication and faith in a fractured world. In a seemingly unrelated sphere, Mira Murati’s journey as a leading mind behind AI (notably as the “mother” of ChatGPT) and founder of Thinking Machines Lab embodies parallel motifs. Both the novel and Murati’s real-life mission grapple with **deep questions of knowledge, guidance, communication, and the alignment of powerful forces with human values**. This interpretive analysis will explore those parallels theme by theme – examining Murdoch’s character archetypes and motifs, and drawing resonances with Murati’s vision for democratic, human-aligned AI. Throughout, we will see how a literary tale of prophets and disciples, spiritual crises, and elusive revelations finds an unexpected mirror in the story of a technologist shaping the future of artificial intelligence.

## Prophets, Visionaries, and Fallible Sages

**In Murdoch’s novel:** The character **Marcus Vallar** stands as a quasi-prophetic figure – a former mathematician-turned-painter who performs what seems like a miracle. Vallar utters a few words over his dying friend Patrick Fenman, who then recovers from a mysterious, terminal illness. This act marks Vallar as a **“charismatic thinker and healer”**, inspiring awe among those who witness or hear of it. In Murdoch’s fictional universe, Marcus fits the archetype of the **“enchanter”**, a recurring type in her novels: a charismatic, masterful older man who exerts a powerful influence on others. Like a *prophet* or *sage*, he holds elusive wisdom – Alfred Ludens (his young admirer) even believes Marcus *“has discovered a secret which is of vital importance to mankind”*. Yet, crucially, Marcus is **fallible**. Far from a perfect messiah, he is troubled and reluctant. After initially accepting followers who flock to him as a holy man, Marcus later **renounces** that role of savior. Murdoch uses this **fallible prophet** archetype to raise questions about the nature of spiritual leadership: Marcus’s life echoes Jesus in certain respects (a miraculous healing, disciples, hints of sacrifice), but he is no divine figure – he is mortal, mentally fragile, and haunted by the weight of human suffering (particularly the Holocaust, which obsesses him). This **tension between visionary authority and human frailty** is at the heart of the novel’s drama.

**In Murati’s AI journey:** Mira Murati can be seen as a modern kind of visionary – not a prophet of religion, but a **visionary technologist** guiding a transformative “creation.” Often described as a *“key architect behind ChatGPT”*, Murati provided the technical leadership and foresight that brought this AI system to life. While she isn’t a prophet in the mystical sense, she has acted as a **thought leader with a far-reaching vision** for AI. Under her leadership as CTO, OpenAI moved from pure research into globally impactful products. In a way, Murati and her team delivered a kind of “message to the planet” as well – ChatGPT’s release was a landmark moment that *“captivated the world”* by making a new form of intelligence accessible to millions. Like Murdoch’s Marcus, however, this technological “oracle” proved **fallible**. Murati has been candid that ChatGPT and similar AI models are *not* infallible sages – they can err or “hallucinate,” and need careful guidance and improvement. She has taken on the **responsibility to acknowledge and fix these flaws**, guiding OpenAI’s vision to address issues like AI misinformation and bias. This echoes the novel’s theme: just as Marcus, the revered healer, ultimately shows vulnerability and limits, ChatGPT’s creators (led by Murati) recognize that their seemingly all-knowing AI is imperfect and must be aligned with truth and ethics. Murati’s role has been to **balance bold vision with humility and oversight** – a balance also demanded of Murdoch’s would-be prophet. Both contexts remind us that great power (spiritual or technological) must be tempered by realism about its limits.

Furthermore, Murati’s visionary role includes an almost **missionary zeal for ethics and human-centric AI** – one might say a philosophical bent. She has articulated the belief that *“AI should serve humanity, not replace it,”* setting a tone of service rather than domination. In this way, Murati stands as a guiding visionary much like Marcus Vallar tried to be for his followers: she is pointing toward a future where advanced AI is a benefactor of humanity. But unlike Murdoch’s solitary mystic, Murati operates within a community and industry, striving to convince peers and the public of her vision. The **metaphysical question of a savior** is thus transformed: instead of a single prophet redeeming a fallen world, Murati’s quest is to shape *AI itself* into a kind of tool for redemption – a technology that could help solve problems and uplift people, while avoiding the stance of a false god. This modern vision retains the novel’s skepticism of any one infallible savior. Murati’s AI “prophecies” are always paired with safeguards, research, and collaboration, emphasizing that **no single genius (human or machine) can single-handedly deliver salvation**.

## Master and Disciple: Mentorship and Guidance

**In the novel:** Another core archetypal relationship in *The Message to the Planet* is that of **master and disciple**. **Alfred Ludens**, a young history professor, is the disciple figure who is both devoted to and intellectually skeptical of Marcus Vallar. Ludens initially seeks out Marcus (his former mentor) with a dual hope: to save their friend Patrick through Marcus’s power, and to persuade Marcus to share his profound philosophical ideas in writing. This dynamic highlights mentorship, **intellectual apprenticeship**, and the complexity of faith between generations. Murdoch frequently explores such mentor–protégé relationships; indeed, the novel explicitly “explores the relationship between a master and his disciple, Vallar and Ludens”. Alfred is an **ardent but uncertain disciple** – he believes in Marcus’s importance but struggles with doubt. Notably, their roles at times invert: the disciple tries to *guide the mentor* (Alfred urges Marcus to write down his message, effectively pushing his teacher to fulfill what Alfred sees as his responsibility to humanity). This inversion adds realism to the archetype: the mentor is not all-knowing or eager to preach, and the student must question and prod. Surrounding this pair are other mentorship echoes: for instance, the artist **Jack Sheerwater** was once Marcus’s painting tutor, illustrating how even the “master” Marcus was a student in another domain (art). Yet Jack himself is morally fallible (involved in selfish romantic entanglements), which subtly shows that **teachers can fail to provide moral guidance**. Overall, Murdoch uses these intertwined mentor–student relationships to ask: *How do we seek guidance and knowledge?* and *What happens when our guides are imperfect?* Alfred’s journey is one of **yearning for wisdom** – he craves a teacher in Marcus, a guide to life’s meaning, but must come to terms with Marcus’s human limitations.

**In Murati’s world:** Mentorship and guidance also play a crucial role in Mira Murati’s narrative, albeit in a modern form. Murati herself emerged as a leader relatively early – by her mid-30s she was CTO of OpenAI, guiding teams of researchers and engineers. In that capacity, she acted as a **mentor and architect** to the creation of advanced AI systems. Colleagues have noted her *“ability to assemble teams with technical expertise, commercial acumen, and a deep appreciation for the importance of mission”*. This speaks to her role as a mentor/leader: she guided a diverse team to share in a common vision (much as a philosophical mentor would gather disciples around an idea). If Marcus Vallar had Alfred to carry forth his ideas, Murati had an entire organization to lead in implementing AI ideas. Under her leadership, OpenAI shifted from pure research into real-world impact, implying she taught the organization how to **productize and responsibly deploy** AI. In a sense, **ChatGPT itself can be seen as Murati’s “disciple.”** She oversaw its development and training, effectively *teaching* this AI model how to interact with humans. Through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), Murati’s team acted as tutors instilling guidelines and values into the AI. This mirrors the mentor–student dynamic: humans (led by Murati’s vision) training an intelligent system to **align with human communication and ethics**. We might whimsically say that if Murati is the “mother” of ChatGPT, she is also its teacher – nurturing it from a raw model into a conversational agent that can serve users. Her guidance continues as she addresses the AI’s shortcomings (each fix or update is a lesson imparted to the AI on how to behave better).

There is also an element of **seeking mentorship** in Murati’s personal journey. Just as Alfred Ludens traveled in search of guidance, Murati left her home in Albania at 16 to seek education and opportunities abroad. Her path took her through elite institutions and companies (Dartmouth, then Tesla and Leap Motion) where she undoubtedly learned from seasoned mentors in engineering and product development before arriving at OpenAI. By the time she took the helm of ChatGPT’s development, she synthesized those lessons into her own leadership style – much as Alfred Ludens tries to synthesize Marcus’s elusive wisdom into a communicable form. **Mentorship, then, comes full circle**: Murati grew from a mentee in cutting-edge tech environments to a mentor shaping the frontier of AI. The difference in her story is the collaborative nature of modern tech versus the singular master of Murdoch’s novel. Murati’s “disciples” were not blind followers but expert colleagues, and the “wisdom” was built together. Yet, the core theme remains: the transfer of knowledge and values is essential in both realms. Murdoch shows a disciple coming to terms with a mentor’s flaws, and Murati demonstrates a mentor who must constantly learn and adapt (for example, learning from real-world feedback on ChatGPT). Both suggest that **true guidance is a two-way street** – the best mentors remain students at heart, and the best disciples think for themselves. Murati’s emphasis on team collaboration and feedback aligns well with that ideal.

## Communication and the Ineffability of Meaning

**In the novel:** *The Message to the Planet* centers on the idea of a **profound message that is nearly impossible to communicate**. The very title hints at a universal communication or revelation meant for humanity, yet Murdoch deliberately plays with ambiguity. Does Marcus Vallar actually have a momentous insight or “message” for mankind? The novel remains **inconclusive** on this point – indeed, by the end we *“never find out whether there actually was a message to the planet, and if so, what it said or who sent it.”*. Murdoch thereby emphasizes the **ineffability of certain truths**. Marcus struggles immensely to articulate his philosophical or spiritual insights. At one juncture, he suggests that the truths he perceives would *“become trivial if turned into English”*, which is why he is drawn to ideas of a **universal or original language** to express them. This is a powerful motif: the inadequacy of ordinary language to convey extraordinary meaning. Alfred Ludens, in his role as intermediary, is akin to an evangelist figure (the gospel-writer parallel has been noted by critics), trying to translate Marcus’s enigmatic persona and ideas for others. But Alfred himself is not a true believer – he’s a skeptical interpreter, meaning the **chain of communication is doubly strained** (the “message” passes from Marcus’s mind, through Alfred’s skeptical pen, to us). All of this highlights **communication** as a fraught process in the novel. Characters yearn to understand one another’s inner truths – be it spiritual philosophy, or even simple emotional truth in the case of the tangled love triangle subplot – yet miscommunication and *“lengthy stasis”* plague them. Murdoch’s use of multiple perspectives (friends each have their own idea of who Marcus really is) further underlines that **meaning is subjective and elusive**. The ultimate irony is that the **“message to the planet” might lie in the attempt and failure to deliver a clear message** – a meta-commentary that in human life, final answers are hard to come by and must be intuited beyond words.

**In Murati’s AI context:** Communication is the literal domain of **ChatGPT** – an AI model designed to engage in human-like dialogue. Murati’s work on ChatGPT and her new venture, Thinking Machines Lab, directly grapples with bridging gaps in understanding between humans and the vast world of AI-driven information. One could say that ChatGPT is itself a *medium* for delivering knowledge globally – almost a “message to the planet” in a benign sense – as it *“generates human-quality text”* to answer questions and assist people across languages and domains. However, just like Marcus Vallar’s dilemma with language, ChatGPT has confronted the challenge of **meaning and truth being lost in translation**. When Marcus fears his insights turn trivial in English, we are reminded of how AI language models sometimes produce superficially fluent answers that mask a lack of true understanding – *the content can become trivial or distorted* if the model doesn’t truly grasp the nuance. Murati has been particularly aware of this; she has guided OpenAI’s efforts to reduce instances of AI “hallucinations” (false or nonsensical outputs). In essence, she is tackling the problem of **ineffability from the opposite direction**: rather than a wise sage struggling to compress truth into words, we have a hyper-verbal AI that can produce endless words without necessarily grasping truth. The risk is miscommunication or misinformation. Murati’s response has been to emphasize transparency and understanding – for the *public* as well as the AI. She noted a *“serious gap between rapidly advancing AI and the public’s understanding of the technology”* and founded Thinking Machines Lab to help **“make AI more useful and accessible”**, explicitly aiming to fill the understanding gap. This is akin to providing a clear *commentary* or *translation* of the AI’s workings to the world, much as Alfred Ludens tried to interpret Marcus’s revelations for others.

Murati’s focus on **accessibility and education** – publishing technical notes, sharing code, demystifying AI – resonates with the novel’s theme by inverting it: where Murdoch shows a message that cannot quite be delivered, Murati is striving to ensure the “messages” from AI are **comprehensible and broadly shared**. The parallel is that both acknowledge how critical *communication* is in shaping human destiny. In the novel, a single message (if only it could be expressed) might alter lives; in Murati’s world, AI systems communicate millions of messages daily, so ensuring those are accurate and aligned with human needs is vitally important. Murati’s insistence that science is better when shared openly and that AI should be customizable to people’s values can be seen as efforts to prevent the **fragmentation of meaning** that Murdoch dramatizes. Everyone shouldn’t receive a different, possibly false “gospel” from AI; instead, people should **understand what the AI says and why**, and even shape it to their own purposes. In short, **Murati is effectively trying to give the planet a *legible*, *human-aligned* message through AI**, as opposed to Murdoch’s scenario of an indecipherable revelation. The thematic kinship lies in the recognition that *communication can either elevate or mislead*. Both Murdoch’s novel and Murati’s AI work warn that without clarity and integrity in how messages are conveyed, we end up with confusion or disillusionment. And both suggest that achieving true understanding is a profound, perhaps never-ending quest.

## Fragmentation of Faith vs. Alignment of AI (Healing a Fractured Humanity)

**In the novel:** Murdoch situates her characters in a world of **spiritual fragmentation and disillusionment**. Marcus Vallar’s personal crisis – his obsession with the suffering of the Jews and the horrors of the Holocaust – exemplifies the way 20th-century trauma fractured humanity’s sense of meaning. He carries the burden of *“the dilemma of the religious leader with power and his relationship to suffering”*, feeling acutely the question: how can any guiding truth or God justify the enormous pain in the world? This weight contributes to his retreat from public life into a private mental institution, suggesting a kind of breakdown under the pressure of cosmic injustice. Around Marcus, we see people **yearning for wholeness**: the *“new age travellers”* and other seekers who camp outside to witness the healer hint at a society grasping for spiritual unity or healing in an age of uncertainty. Yet the novel delivers no simple unifying revelation; instead, it presents **multiple clashing perspectives** and unresolved tensions. The ménage à trois subplot (Jack, Franca, Alison) symbolizes **fragmentation at the level of love and family** – a little portrait of “fractured humanity.” Jack’s selfish pursuit of simultaneous loves leads to emotional harm and separation (Franca and Alison both leave him eventually). Murdoch’s commentary here is that **egoism and selfishness inherent in erotic love** can shatter relationships, just as selfish pursuits shatter broader social bonds. By the novel’s end, Marcus is dead and the once tightly knit circle of friends has been altered and scattered; there is no grand moment of *e pluribus unum*. In this sense, *The Message to the Planet* portrays a modern reality of **broken connections, unfulfilled spiritual longings, and moral ambiguity** – a planet in need of a message, but with no consensus on what that message should be or who should deliver it.

**In Murati’s mission:** The concept of **“alignment” in AI** directly speaks to preventing fragmentation – ensuring that AI systems remain aligned with *human values and needs* so that technology doesn’t become alien or harmful to humanity. Murati has been a strong advocate of **developing AI that is ethical, inclusive, and benefits everyone**, essentially seeking to *unify* AI’s trajectory with the interests of humanity. This is reminiscent of a healer trying to tend to a “fractured humanity,” but in a modern way: by preempting new fractures that uncontrolled AI could cause (such as widened inequality, or AI acting in ways contrary to human welfare). At OpenAI, Murati oversaw the **safety teams and ethical frameworks** that aimed to curb biases and prevent misuse of AI. This work acknowledges the fragmented reality of society – different groups have different values and vulnerabilities – and tries to create AI that *works for everyone* rather than exacerbating divisions. In fact, Murati’s new startup is structured as a **public benefit corporation** explicitly to serve the public good, not just profit. Its mission statement speaks to *“building a future where everyone has access to the knowledge and tools to make AI work for their unique needs and goals”*, noting that current AI knowledge is concentrated in a few hands and needs to be **more widely distributed and understood**. This is essentially a plan to **heal the rift** between the AI elite and the general public, so that AI doesn’t become a force that divides “haves and have-nots” of information. We might call this a push for **“democratic AI”**, analogous to a spiritual leader trying to bring a fragmented flock together under a common, benevolent purpose.

There is also a philosophical resonance in the idea of **collective suffering and redemption**. Marcus was tormented by collective human suffering (the Holocaust) and how to redeem meaning from it. Murati and many AI ethicists are preoccupied with preventing suffering that could be unleashed by misuse of AI (whether it’s misinformation harm, job displacement, or even existential risks). By steering AI development toward collaboration with humans and focusing on solving real human problems (rather than just pursuing AI’s capabilities in isolation), Murati’s approach seeks to redeem technology’s promise as a tool for healing and empowerment. The **ambition of “human-aligned AI”** is to ensure these powerful systems do not stray from the values and well-being of humanity – essentially to avoid a future where an unaligned “digital prophet” leads people astray or causes harm. In the novel, Marcus’s relationship to humanity is fraught: he has wisdom but can’t translate it to save everyone; he empathizes deeply with suffering but feels impotent to resolve it globally. In the real world, Murati faces a similar humbling truth: no single AI (or person) can by itself “save” humanity’s problems. However, her strategy is collective and pragmatic – by **“collaborating with the wider community”** and sharing research openly, she hopes many minds together can align AI with human interests. This communal approach might be what was missing in Murdoch’s story of an isolated prophet. It is as if Murati is attempting to do, in the technological realm, what no lone sage could do in the spiritual realm: **build a framework where the knowledge that guides us is transparent, shared, and continuously checked by many, thus keeping it aligned with our diverse human values**. In summary, while Murdoch’s novel dramatizes the despair of a fragmented humanity without a clear beacon, Murati’s work represents an active effort to **create guiding beacons (in AI) that are intentionally *in tune* with human morals and needs**, to help bring society closer together rather than drive it apart.

## Redemption and Responsibility: The Healer’s Burden

**In the novel:** Redemption is a subtle but persistent theme in *The Message to the Planet*. The initial miracle – Patrick Fenman’s inexplicable recovery – positions Marcus Vallar as a potential **redeemer** figure (Patrick was effectively brought back from the brink of death, a literal salvation). Yet Murdoch complicates the notion of redemption. Patrick believed he was **cursed** by Marcus earlier (he attributes his wasting illness to Marcus’s curse), so Marcus’s act of healing can be read as an attempt at **personal atonement** – lifting a curse he laid in anger. This casts Marcus not as an immaculate healer, but as a **fallible man seeking redemption for his own guilt**. Throughout the story, characters wrestle with guilt and the desire for forgiveness or healing: Marcus with his moral and existential guilt, Ludens perhaps for doubting his mentor, and even the adulterous Jack seems dimly aware that his selfish actions damage others (though he’s slow to repent). By the novel’s conclusion, redemption remains ambiguous. Marcus dies, which could be seen as a Christ-like sacrifice or simply a tragic demise; either way, his death does not clearly *redeem* the world around him – it leaves questions open. Franca and Jack’s marriage persists but scarred; one could ask if Jack is redeemed by Franca staying, or if Franca is sacrificing herself with no redemption for her suffering. In Murdoch’s moral landscape, **redemption is hard-won and often incomplete**. The characters are left to pick up pieces rather than bask in a resolved salvation. This ties into Murdoch’s broader philosophical outlook that goodness and forgiveness are complex, ongoing endeavors rather than neat endings. The **“spiritual healer”** archetype in Marcus demonstrates that even someone who can heal others physically may not be able to heal the spiritual brokenness within or around them fully. The burden of playing savior weighs heavily on him, ultimately contributing to his withdrawal and demise, which is a commentary on the **cost of taking on too much responsibility for others’ souls or lives**.

**In Murati’s role:** Mira Murati has never claimed to be a savior, but the rhetoric around AI often edges into utopian hopes (AI curing diseases, solving climate change, etc.) as well as dystopian fears. In this environment, Murati has assumed a role that carries a kind of **responsibility for the future** – an ethical burden to ensure AI helps rather than harms. We might analogize this to the “healer’s burden” in the novel. Murati’s approach to AI has been very much about *redemptive potential*: using AI to *“solve real-world problems and create lasting change”*, which implies alleviating suffering (be it through education, healthcare, or other applications). By pushing for AI that collaborates with humans and is accessible to all, she envisions AI as a **tool of empowerment and perhaps societal healing** (for instance, providing personalized education to under-served areas, or medical insights to patients globally). This is AI in a *redemptive role* for some of humanity’s challenges. But Murati also recognizes the flipside – the **fallibility and potential harm of AI** – and thus takes on the **responsibility of governance and alignment**. In a sense, she is guarding against the scenario where AI, intended as a healer, could become a curse (just as Marcus’s gift had once been perceived as a curse by Patrick). Her leadership in implementing safety measures, bias mitigations, and advocating for transparency is about **preventing the need for redemption by avoiding “sins” in the first place**. She often speaks about proactive ethics and has supported calls for AI regulation and oversight, which is a form of humility and responsibility-taking rare in the tech world.

One can see an element of **personal redemption** in her journey as well. After the tumult at OpenAI (where she served briefly as interim CEO during a crisis), Murati stepped away to start fresh with a new lab, presumably to realign with her core mission. By choosing the structure of a public benefit corporation and emphasizing openness, she perhaps sought to **“redeem” the trajectory of AI development** from the more secretive, profit-driven race it was becoming. In that sense, her path reflects a conscious course-correction – analogous to someone atoning and setting things right. While the stakes are different, the underpinning motif is similar to Murdoch’s characters: recognizing one’s part in a flawed system and trying to fix or improve it. Murati’s lab aims to *“unlock… transformative applications and benefits”* of AI but *with* a high safety bar and collaboration, which is balancing ambition with moral responsibility. This is precisely the balance a would-be redeemer must strike: **boldly seeking to heal, while being cautious not to harm**.

Lastly, consider the metaphor of **ChatGPT as a kind of spiritual experiment**: People often turned to ChatGPT for advice, even emotional support, in its early widespread use. Murati’s team was then faced with users treating the AI as confidant or counselor – roles that touch on the spiritual or psychological well-being of users. Ensuring that the AI responded helpfully and not harmfully in such sensitive situations was another form of **responsibility** they shouldered. We might say Murati became a *“mentor of a healer”* – she had to guide and shape ChatGPT so that it could responsibly assist people (to some minor extent “heal” or comfort through conversation) without overstepping or causing distress. It’s a nuanced, real-world version of a healer’s role distributed into a tool. **Murati’s ambitions for human-aligned AI have a redemptive quality**: they seek to **restore trust and hope** that technology can serve the common good, at a time when many are cynical or fearful. In literature, a character might try to redeem the world through faith or sacrifice; in AI, Murati and her peers try to redeem it through *design*, *ethics*, and *inclusive innovation*. Both are profound endeavors contending with human fallibility – Marcus ultimately fails under the weight, whereas Murati’s story is still unfolding with cautious optimism.

## Conclusion

At first glance, Iris Murdoch’s *The Message to the Planet* – a dense novel of mysticism, philosophy, and human foibles – and Mira Murati’s career in cutting-edge AI might seem worlds apart. Yet, as we’ve explored, they **converge on timeless themes**. Both deal with figures who become focal points for hope and meaning – Murdoch’s healer-prophet Marcus and the AI visionary Murati – and both confront the challenges inherent in that role. **Character archetypes** resonate across the divide: the wise yet flawed mentor, the earnest disciple, the seekers and skeptics, even the “miracle-worker” (be it a spiritual cure or a technological breakthrough) followed by crowds hungry for answers. **Philosophical motifs** likewise intertwine: the quest to articulate the ineffable truth, the struggle to align great power with good and to maintain integrity amid fragmented realities, and the understanding that neither spiritual enlightenment nor advanced technology will deliver *pat* answers or instant salvation. In Murdoch’s novel, the absence of a clear final message is a message in itself – it urges readers to live with ambiguity, to continue seeking. In Murati’s continuing work, there is a similar humility: an acknowledgement that AI’s integration into society is an ongoing journey requiring wisdom, feedback, and adaptation, not a single triumphant revelation.

Ultimately, the **resonance between the two “Messages to the Planet” – one literary, one technological – lies in their shared human concerns**. They ask: How do we guide others (or our creations) responsibly? How do we communicate what truly matters? How do we heal or help a world that is often divided and suffering? Murdoch offers a cautionary tale about charismatic knowledge-bearers and the limits of any one person’s vision. Murati, perhaps heeding such lessons in her own realm, leans on collaboration, transparency, and ethical guardrails to ensure AI serves as a positive force. Both imply that **no single prophet – human or machine – can fix humanity, but with mentorship, communication, and alignment of values, we can inch closer to the light**. In drawing these parallels, we see that literature and technology are part of one continuous human story: our search for meaning and improvement, and the narratives we create to understand the powers that might shape our destiny.

**Sources:** The analysis above has drawn on interpretations of Murdoch’s novel and commentary on its themes, as well as on documented insights into Mira Murati’s career and philosophy – including her role in developing ChatGPT, her advocacy for ethical AI, and the mission of her Thinking Machines Lab – to illustrate the symbolic and thematic dialogue between these two domains.
