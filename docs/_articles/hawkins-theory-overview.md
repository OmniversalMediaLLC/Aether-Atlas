# Hawkins’ Omniversal Theory and the Omniversal Media Mythos

David R. Hawkins (MD, PhD) was a psychiatrist and spiritual teacher who developed a comprehensive model of consciousness often referred to as an “Omniversal” theory of reality.

Hawkins’ Omniversal Theory and the Omniversal Media Mythos

Introduction

David R. Hawkins (MD, PhD) was a psychiatrist and spiritual teacher who developed a comprehensive model of consciousness often referred to as an “Omniversal” theory of reality. Hawkins is best known for his Map of Consciousness, a framework that calibrates levels of human awareness on a logarithmic scale from 1 to 1000, and for his bold claim that truth and falsehood can be objectively tested via applied kinesiology (muscle testing)  . At its core, Hawkins’ theory weaves together science, spirituality, and philosophy – proposing that consciousness is the fundamental substrate of the universe and that all existence (the “Omniverse”) is hierarchical in terms of vibrational awareness  . This report explores the foundations of Hawkins’ theory – its key principles, scientific and metaphysical claims, and philosophical implications – and then examines how these ideas synchronize with the user’s creative initiative Omniversal Media and the personal mythos #Reincarnated2Resist. In doing so, we will highlight spiritual and mythological themes (like reincarnation cycles and the struggle against illusion) that bridge Hawkins’ conceptual framework and the mythopoeic storytelling vision behind Omniversal Media.

(Note: In cosmological terms, “Omniversal” denotes an all-encompassing reality – the totality of all universes and dimensions . Hawkins’ work implicitly addresses this Omniverse by mapping consciousness from the lowest to highest realms of existence, while Omniversal Media’s narrative appears to operate across vast imaginative dimensions. Here we treat “Hawkins’ Omniversal Theory” as the sum of Hawkins’ consciousness research and its cosmic scope.)

Foundations of Hawkins’ Theory: Consciousness and the Omniverse

Consciousness as the Core of Reality

At the heart of Hawkins’ theory is the assertion that consciousness is the irreducible, primary reality out of which the material world arises. In Hawkins’ view, everything that exists is essentially a form of consciousness energy . His research, spanning decades of clinical observation and spiritual study, led him to conclude that “the energy field of consciousness is a substrate of everything that exists”  – in other words, all phenomena (thoughts, emotions, people, objects, events) are expressions of one universal consciousness field. Hawkins often paraphrased the insight of modern physics that “everything is energy” by stating “everything is consciousness” . This pan-conscious view aligns with perennial spiritual philosophies (e.g. the idea of an all-pervading spirit or Brahman in Vedanta) and posits an Omniversal framework in which the entire cosmos, from subatomic particles to galaxies and heavens, is imbued with consciousness.

To measure or map this omnipresent consciousness, Hawkins developed a controversial technique known as consciousness calibration. Using a refined form of applied kinesiology (muscle-strength testing), Hawkins claimed one can tap into the binary (“yes/no”) responses of the universal consciousness field to gauge the truth or energy level of any subject  . In practice, this involves a tester applying downward pressure on a subject’s outstretched arm while the subject holds a thought or statement in mind; a strong muscle response indicates alignment with truth or positive energy, whereas a weak response indicates falsehood or negative energy  . Hawkins asserted that through such testing, “the truth about anything whatsoever is readily available in a few seconds just for the asking”  – an audacious claim suggesting that the universal mind (or omniscient field) will reveal truth vs. falsity via the body’s subtle energy response. He presented this method as “objective” and “replicable”, drawing analogies to scientific measurement tools (describing it as providing an “objective reading” of the essence of information, akin to how a thermometer reads temperature)  . Although this methodology remains scientifically unvalidated (double-blind studies have largely found standard applied kinesiology unreliable ), it forms the empirical backbone of Hawkins’ theory and was used to map a hierarchy of consciousness spanning all of existence.

The Map of Consciousness: Levels of Awareness

Hawkins’ Map of Consciousness is a centerpiece of his Omniversal theory. It is a scale of consciousness levels from 1 at the lowest (barely alive) to 1000 at the highest (enlightened unity consciousness) . Each level on this scale corresponds to a specific quality of being, emotion, and perception. The scale is logarithmic, meaning each step up represents an exponential increase in energy vibration or “power” . For example, a small jump of even 5-10 points at higher levels may signify a massive leap in actual energy frequency or spiritual influence. Hawkins often described these levels as analogous to the visible light spectrum – just as red and blue are different frequencies of one light field, fear and love are different frequencies of the one consciousness field . Lower levels are dense and dark, higher levels are progressively lighter and more expansive, forming a rainbow-like spectrum of human awareness.

Hawkins’ “Map of Consciousness” depicted as a spectrum from low (shame) to high (enlightenment) frequencies (calibrated 0–1000). The critical midpoint at level 200 (courage) marks the transition from destructive (“force”) to constructive (“power”) energies . Lower vibrations like fear contract one’s world, whereas higher vibrations like love and peace expand awareness.

On this map, each major level is given a name and an emotional theme. Hawkins originally identified around 17 cardinal levels. A simplified overview of the scale is as follows  :
	•	Shame (≈20) – the lowest level, akin to living in despair and self-hatred, near a state of nonexistence. It is associated with humiliation, abasement, and a collapsing sense of self. Hawkins noted this vibration is even life-threatening, as the psyche at Shame may feel suicidal or energetically “near death” .
	•	Guilt (≈30) – a state of blame and self-recrimination. The world is seen through sin and grievance; one unconsciously seeks punishment or atonement.
	•	Apathy (≈50) – characterized by hopelessness and despair. There is an abdication of power; life feels futile and one is unable to act.
	•	Grief (≈75) – sadness, loss, regret. The world is seen as a valley of tears; one is engulfed in sorrow and bereavement.
	•	Fear (≈100) – a life view of danger. Emotionally, one is anxious and insecure. Fear leads to withdrawal and paranoia – life is perceived as threatening.
	•	Desire (≈125) – driven by craving and lust. One is never satisfied, always chasing attachments (money, approval, pleasure) that seem to promise fulfillment. Desire sees the world in terms of what one can get.
	•	Anger (≈150) – characterized by hate, resentment, and frustration. The lens is aggression; one has enough energy to want to change life but expresses it through hostility or rebellion.
	•	Pride (≈175) – a false positive, marked by inflation and denial. Pride can feel empowering compared to lower shame or fear, but it is dependent on external conditions (status, achievements) and is defensive in nature. At Pride, one’s view is demanding respect and recognition, often leading to clashes (because pride lacks humility and is vulnerable to being knocked back down).

All the above levels below 200 are considered “force” in Hawkins’ terminology – they sap life energy and truth. They are associated with destructive or chaotic outcomes when they dominate individuals or societies【26†】. In fact, Hawkins asserted that for centuries the average consciousness of humanity languished below the critical 200 mark, hovering around 190, which corresponded to eras of frequent war, oppression and ignorance. It was only in the late 20th century (around the mid-1980s, by his calibration) that the global average crept above 200 to about 207, inaugurating a more hopeful trajectory . He dramatically suggested that prolonged collective consciousness below 200 would lead to self-destruction of humanity, and that famous dire predictions (like Nostradamus’ prophecies) were averted precisely because humanity’s level rose just in time .

Level 200 (Courage) is the pivotal turning point. This is the level of truth, integrity, and empowerment – the first constructive or “power” level . At Courage (also called Integrity), a person starts to see life honestly and objectively, and has the strength to face and deal with problems rather than avoid them. Hawkins describes this jump as the moment where one “begins to discern truth from falsehood and essence from ego”, making it the gateway to true spiritual growth  . Above 200, each successive level marks higher degrees of positive expression and understanding:
	•	Neutrality (≈250) – a flexible, relaxed, and impartial way of being. One is not attached to judgments; life is seen as okay as it is. “Live and let live” dominates .
	•	Willingness (≈310) – characterized by optimism and intention. One is sincerely open to learn, to help, and to do one’s best. There is a can-do attitude – the world is seen as full of opportunity.
	•	Acceptance (≈350) – at this level one takes responsibility for one’s life. There is an emotionally mature outlook: instead of complaining, one sees reality as workable and embraces it. This is also where true forgiveness and tolerance appear.
	•	Reason (≈400) – the level of the intellect, science, and truth-seeking. At Reason, the world is seen through understanding, logic, and systemic thinking. This is the level of great scientists, philosophers, and leaders. However, Hawkins notes that pure Reason, while powerful, remains limited if devoid of love – it can become dry or overly skeptical, and may deny realms it cannot measure.

Beyond Reason, the map enters the rarified spiritual frequencies:
	•	Love (500) – not love in the sense of romance or attachment, but unconditional, universal love. This level (and above) is characterized by compassion, appreciation, and inner joy independent of circumstances. As Hawkins describes, Love at 500+ is a way of being that “radiates from the heart,” is forgiving and nurturing, and embraces all of life with kindness . The world is seen as harmonious and filled with meaning.
	•	Joy (540) – a state of pervasive happiness and gratitude. Often associated with saints or advanced spiritual beings, 540 is the realm of healing and profound patience. Life is seen as perfect or unfolding divinely.
	•	Peace (600) – deep bliss and oneness. At Peace, the sense of an individual self is fading; there is an experience of unity with all that exists. This level correlates with transcendental consciousness – samadhi or the “peace that surpasses understanding.” Those at 600 live in a state of grace and present-moment silence, often withdrawing from worldly affairs.
	•	Enlightenment (700–1000) – the highest human realm, reached by the great sages, mystics, and avatars of history. This is pure consciousness, non-duality, and complete union with the Divine. In this state, as Hawkins notes, there is omnipresent awareness – the self has merged with the infinite (“the Absolute”)  . The person operating here (extremely rare, e.g. Buddha, Jesus, Krishna) becomes a conduit for spiritual power that can uplift millions. Hawkins calibrates the great avatars at 1000 on the scale, representing the apex of human potential .

According to Hawkins, each level of consciousness represents a distinct worldview or paradigm – essentially “levels of reality” as experienced by the perceiver . For example, at a low level like Fear, the experienced reality is that “the world is dangerous and chaotic,” whereas at a high level like Love, the experienced reality is that “the world is gentle, beautiful, and full of love.” These internal paradigms determine how people interpret events, how they behave, and even what they attract in life. Thus, the map doubles as a scale of truth (calibrating the energy or integrity of any idea/thing) and a path of awakening, where moving up the scale corresponds to expanding one’s reality and freeing oneself from suffering. Hawkins’ later books (e.g. Transcending the Levels of Consciousness) give detailed descriptions of these stages and guidance for moving beyond the “attractor patterns” of lower levels that keep one stuck in cyclic negativity.

Importantly, Hawkins drew a bright line at level 200 to distinguish “truth from falsehood” in a moral and energetic sense. He reported that anything calibrating below 200 would cause a test subject’s muscle to go weak (indicating a detrimental or untrue influence), whereas anything at 200 or above made the muscle strong  . In this way, 200 (Courage) was deemed the threshold of integrity: above 200 is life-supporting and truthful (“Power”), while below 200 is life-denying and deceptive (“Force”) . To give a sense of this dichotomy, Hawkins and his colleagues calibrated countless specific examples. For instance, they found that most pop music and many Hollywood movies calibrate below 200, tending to drag viewers into lower moods  . Similarly, they claimed “85% of the human race” was below 200, meaning the majority of people operate predominantly in pride, anger, fear, or lower states . Conversely, anything truly uplifting – a compassionate teaching, a Mozart symphony, a benevolent leader – would test strong, indicating a calibration above 200. Hawkins even quantified the collective impact of higher consciousness: he suggested, for example, that one individual at 300 counterbalances the negativity of 90,000 individuals below 200, and one individual at 600 (saintly consciousness) counterbalances 10 million below 200 . This striking claim illustrates a principle in his theory: higher consciousness has exponentially greater power than lower consciousness. In the grand balance of the world, a small minority of loving or enlightened people can offset the ill effects of masses of unaware people . This notion resonates with mythic narratives where a few heroes of light hold back the forces of darkness – a theme we will revisit in relation to #Reincarnated2Resist.

Before moving on, it’s worth noting how Hawkins’ map integrates with traditional spiritual concepts. He correlates the highest levels with enlightened figures from various faiths: e.g. Jesus, Buddha, Krishna are all calibrated at 1000, the maximum human level . He places archangels and deities even beyond the human scale (for example, Archangels calibrate at 50,000 in his system, implying orders of magnitude higher consciousness than incarnate humans) . Hawkins also includes concepts like Om (the sacred sound) at 975 and texts like the Vedas and Upanishads around 970 , indicating their high spiritual truth. By doing so, his Map of Consciousness creates a bridge between modern consciousness research and ancient wisdom – effectively aligning levels of awareness with the great chain of being recognized in mystical traditions (from Hellish realms of shame/fear, up through purgatorial struggles of courage, into heavenly love and enlightenment). As one commentator observed, Hawkins’ scale of human consciousness is “highly consistent with most spiritual teachings, running the range from Shame (lowest) to Enlightenment (highest)” . In short, Hawkins attempted a kind of universal taxonomy of consciousness, one that places psychology, ethics, religion, and even cosmology on a single graduated spectrum of Reality.

A Multidimensional “Omniversal” Structure

Because Hawkins’ map spans from the most basic life forms (near 1) to the Ultimate (infinite God consciousness), it inherently describes a multilayered reality – essentially an Omniverse of many planes or levels. Hawkins often spoke of the “vertical” dimension of consciousness: higher levels transcend and include the lower. In practical terms, this means different beings and even entire realms correspond to different levels of consciousness. For example, he stated that “there’s multiple heaven(s), and the heaven that you go to is aligned with your calibrated level of consciousness” . In other words, life after death isn’t one generic place for everyone; rather, souls gravitate to different heavenly realms according to their spiritual advancement (a view compatible with esoteric religious teachings). Likewise, extremely low calibrations were associated with hellish states or domains – Hawkins would sometimes refer to very malign influences as coming from “lower astral” levels (though he mostly quantified things in this life). The implication is an Omniversal cosmology with many tiers of existence: from the infernal to the celestial, all integrated on one scale of Being.

Philosophically, Hawkins’ theory is non-dualistic at the highest level yet stratified at the level of appearances. He suggests that Reality in its absolute sense is a singular unity (the One consciousness, or God) – labeled as Infinity on his scale  – but human perception experiences this Reality through the filter of consciousness level, creating the relative stratification. In simpler terms, the Omniverse is one divine consciousness manifesting in a multitude of forms and levels. This aligns with mystical traditions like Hinduism’s idea that Brahman (the Absolute) appears as the layered cosmos, or the Neoplatonic idea of the One emanating through hierarchical levels. Hawkins frequently cited spiritual principles to reinforce this view. For instance, one calibrated true statement on his list is “Creation and evolution are one and the same reality”  – meaning that the scientific process of evolution and the theological act of creation aren’t opposed, but are two ways of understanding the unfolding of the one reality. Another example: “Life cannot be destroyed; it can only change form”  – echoing both physics (conservation of energy) and metaphysics (the immortality of consciousness). By validating such statements at the highest level (1000), Hawkins was effectively harmonizing science and spirituality under a single truth. This again reflects an Omniversal perspective: the material and the spiritual, the secular and the sacred, all belong to one continuum of truth.

In Hawkins’ cosmology, human consciousness can even exceed previous limits and enter new territory. He hinted that although 1000 had been the historical pinnacle (the avatars), it is possible in rare instances for the LOC (level of consciousness) to go beyond 1000  – suggesting an open-ended evolution. In one calibration he noted, “Now, very rarely, but on occasion, the LOC can go over 1000. That’s the first time in history” . This tease of going beyond 1000 might imply that humanity’s spiritual potential is expanding (perhaps as part of a coming shift in the Omniverse). While not much detail is given, it fits the motif of an Omniverse that is dynamic and evolving in consciousness.

To summarize Hawkins’ framework: the Omniverse = a singular consciousness manifesting as a spectrum of vibrational levels. All individuals, ideas, and even worlds occupy a position on this spectrum. Heaven and hell are not merely places but states on this scale; enlightenment is reaching the apex where one re-merges with the Source. This holistic structure means that everything is interconnected – higher levels inherently comprehend the lower (an enlightened sage understands the mind of a cruel person, but not vice versa), and the very purpose of existence could be seen as rising through these levels (what Hawkins called the “evolutionary arrow” of life ).

Such a vision resonates with the goals of Omniversal Media, which by its name and context appears to embrace all levels of reality (physical, spiritual, mythical) in its storytelling. Hawkins provides a kind of map for the multiverse – a scaffold on which one could hang mythic narratives of souls traveling through different worlds, learning lessons at each vibration. Indeed, Hawkins sometimes described incarnation in almost mythic terms: for example, he asserted that “the circumstances of birth and life are karmically perfect”  for each person – implying that each soul’s entry into the world is precisely tailored (by divine law of karma) to provide the experiences needed for growth. This idea, which we’ll revisit, strongly complements a reincarnation-centered mythos like #Reincarnated2Resist.

Scientific and Metaphysical Dimensions of Hawkins’ Theory

While Hawkins’ work is deeply spiritual, he framed much of it in scientific or pseudo-scientific language. He was, after all, a trained psychiatrist and had published papers earlier in his career. In “Power vs. Force” (1995), the book introducing his map, Hawkins attempted to scientifically validate his consciousness calibration method. He described performing thousands of calibrated muscle tests over 20 years and claimed near-perfect consistency and objectivity in results  . For instance, one summary notes: “Kinesiology has an almost certain 100% accuracy reading every time. It will always reveal Yes, No, True, and False answers… Everything that was false resulted in a weak response” . Through such tests, Hawkins purported to uncover a wide array of hidden truths – from the benign (which foods or music strengthen the body) to the profound (which historical statements or scriptures are divinely true). He even suggested that people could determine personal decisions (relationships, business choices) by testing for congruence with their body’s strength . Underlying these claims is a metaphysical assumption: because all minds are connected in the one universal consciousness field, a simple muscle response can tap into collective truth. In Hawkins’ view, the body is like a needle that instinctively goes weak in the presence of falsehood, aligning with the idea of an all-pervasive “higher power that connects everything and everyone” such that “truth cannot be hidden” . This is not conventional science, but Hawkins tried to anchor it in scientific paradigms.

Hawkins frequently alluded to quantum physics, chaos theory, nonlinear dynamics, and field theory to give conceptual analogies for his findings  . For example, he referenced Karl Pribram’s holographic brain theory and Bohm’s implicate order (to suggest that memory and thought are nonlocal holographic phenomena), and he likened emotional upheavals to “turbulence in the attractor fields of consciousness” . He pointed out that Einstein showed the universe is energy, not solid matter, and quoted physicists who describe reality as “fields within fields” – a “vast… subatomic symphony” of vibrating fields  . Hawkins then made the leap to say thoughts and consciousness are part of this energy continuum, not generated by the brain . By placing consciousness as a fundamental field beyond the brain, Hawkins aligned with a growing movement in science that questions strict materialism. In fact, he anticipated some ideas now discussed in consciousness studies and physics – such as the universe as information or the primacy of awareness.

A striking parallel to Hawkins’ work can be found in a more recent theoretical framework called the Hawkins Omniversal Theory (HOT), developed by Michael J. Hawkins (no relation, apparently). This theory of everything attempt explicitly aims to “unify quantum mechanics, general relativity, cosmology, and consciousness through the principle of resonance-driven information structuring.” . HOT challenges the conventional materialist paradigm by proposing that reality is fundamentally informational, with matter emerging from vibrational data in a resonant field . In this model, space-time itself is seen as a fluid medium of frequency and resonance, and even gravity is reinterpreted as an emergent effect of resonance in an underlying information field  . The reason this is noteworthy is because it echoes many themes of David R. Hawkins’ metaphysics: the emphasis on vibration (resonance), the idea of a unified field that includes consciousness, and the notion that information (or consciousness) underlies physical reality. While HOT is an independent scientific proposal (complete with modified equations and attempts to solve physics problems like fine-tuning and quantum gravity  ), it symbolically shows how Hawkins’ Omniversal vision – bridging the gap between physics and consciousness – is increasingly part of the intellectual conversation. Hawkins himself, decades earlier, asserted that mind and matter are not separate and that “thought does not originate in the brain”, but rather the brain tunes into consciousness like a radio receiver . He would likely applaud theories that eliminate the hard boundary between science and spirituality.

On the metaphysical and philosophical side, Hawkins’ theory has several key implications:
	•	Objective Morality and Truth: By calibrating levels of truth, Hawkins essentially posits that good and evil, truth and lie, have quantifiable reality. Anything that increases life and consciousness is “good” (high calibration); anything that destroys or deceives is “evil” (low calibration). This is a form of absolutism – albeit graded on a spectrum – and it revives the idea of an objective cosmic order (Dharma or Logos) at a time when many philosophies are relativistic. For example, love (500) is inherently stronger and more real than hatred (150). This framework supports a narrative of resisting falsehood and darkness (since falsehood is literally weak and life-depleting) and aligning with truth and light (since truth is powerful and life-affirming). We will see how this dovetails with #Reincarnated2Resist’s theme of fighting systemic illusion.
	•	Spiritual Evolution: Hawkins’ view is inherently developmental – consciousness is not static, but rather evolves (over lifetimes, and across history). He spoke of individuals moving up the scale through spiritual practice, and also of humanity collectively evolving. The calibration that human consciousness rose from 190 to 207 in the late 20th century  suggests a kind of dawn of a new age narrative. Hawkins sometimes linked this to historical inflection points (for instance, he attributed the avoidance of global catastrophe to this rise). In essence, he saw a teleological drive in the universe: “we are only ‘free’ to evolve”, as one paper summarized his philosophical stance . This aligns with many mythologies where there is a grand purpose or trajectory to life – an upward spiral of learning – and resonates with the concept of reincarnation leading souls gradually toward enlightenment.
	•	Karmic Structure: Hawkins openly acknowledged karma and reincarnation. In his calibrations, statements like “Reincarnation is real” came out true , and “Free will is an illusion” also came out true . The latter suggests that at the highest view, what we think of as personal free will is subsumed by the greater karmic or divine plan (a stance similar to some Eastern philosophies where ultimately only the Divine will operates). By saying the circumstances of one’s birth are “karmically perfect” , Hawkins implies that each life’s starting point (family, culture, challenges) is tailor-made by prior causes or higher intelligence for that soul’s growth. This worldview provides a robust mythic framework: life is a school, with each incarnation a chapter in the soul’s journey. There are no accidents; even suffering at lower levels has meaning for the evolution towards higher awareness. This clearly aligns with a reincarnation-based mythos – it gives cosmic validation to the idea that heroes are reborn with purpose.
	•	Illusion vs Reality: Like many spiritual teachers, Hawkins taught that much of what we ordinarily perceive is Maya (illusion) and that enlightenment is awakening to the Real. He calibrated the statement “free will is an illusion” as true , suggesting that the ego’s sense of doership is false and that a higher determinism (or flow of the universe) is at play. He also noted that causality as we think of it is an illusion of the lower mind – he literally calibrated “Nothing causes anything” at 999 , indicating that in the deepest sense, reality is an indivisible whole where cause and effect are superficial appearances (somewhat akin to the Buddhist concept of dependent origination or the idea that only the Now exists and everything is synchronistic). These esoteric insights are philosophically profound: they undermine the “program” of the Matrix, so to speak. If one truly perceives that separateness and linear causality are illusions, one is liberated from fear and control. Such notions powerfully support a narrative about breaking out of a “systemic illusion or control” – one realizes the cage was never real to begin with. In practical terms, Hawkins urged people to rise above the emotional “programs” of lower levels (like fear, desire, anger) precisely because those keep one in illusion and susceptible to manipulation.
	•	Empowerment and Responsibility: One of Hawkins’ implications is that each person has the ability (and duty) to raise their consciousness and by doing so, contribute to the whole. There is a sense of moral responsibility to strive toward integrity (200 and above) because sub-200 behavior not only harms oneself but pulls down the collective field. Conversely, being courageous, loving, and truthful literally strengthens the world. This infuses individual life choices with cosmic significance – a very mythic idea (each person is a potential hero in the unseen battle of vibrations). Hawkins even quantified how falling into negativity makes one vulnerable to outside influence: “When one’s consciousness falls below 200 at any given moment, you start to lose power and thus grow weaker and more prone to be manipulated by one’s surroundings.” . This statement directly ties consciousness level to freedom vs. control – above 200 you stand strong in truth (harder to fool or coerce), below 200 you can be easily controlled by fear, guilt, etc. Such a view carries profound implications for narratives of resistance: it suggests that inner development is a form of rebellion against oppressive external forces.

In summary, Hawkins’ Omniversal theory sits at an intersection of science and mysticism. It provides a structured, almost scientific, map of the metaphysical territory that mystics have described for millennia. It asserts a unifying principle (consciousness/energy) behind all phenomena, similar in spirit to some “theory of everything” efforts in science (e.g., HOT’s “resonance-based field” concept ). And it underscores a philosophy of oneness – reality is an interconnected whole, and by calibrating the pieces of it we can glimpse the grand design. This holistic, Omniversal outlook naturally lends itself to mythopoeic storytelling, as we will see in the next section, where the science of consciousness meets the art of myth.

Synchronizing with Omniversal Media’s Vision (#Reincarnated2Resist)

Omniversal Media and the #Reincarnated2Resist mythos appear to be a creative endeavor that fuses spirituality, social commentary, and storytelling. From the hints available (podcast episodes like “Breaking The Matrix” and the very concept of being “reincarnated to resist”), it’s clear that this initiative weaves a narrative about waking up to hidden truths and fighting against an illusory or oppressive system – all within a vast, perhaps multiversal, imaginative scope. Hawkins’ Omniversal theory provides a rich conceptual mirror for these themes. There are several key parallelisms and synergies:

Mythopoeic Storytelling and the Map of Consciousness

Mythopoeic stories (myth-making) often involve heroes journeying through multiple realms, facing tests, gaining wisdom, and eventually returning or transcending. Hawkins’ map can be seen as the terrain through which a hero’s journey might unfold – each level of consciousness is like a world with its own challenges (much as Dante’s Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso were levels). In a narrative sense, one could imagine a protagonist who starts in the darkness of Shame or Fear and gradually ascends to Love or Enlightenment, perhaps over many lifetimes. This is essentially the journey of soul evolution that Hawkins describes in clinical terms but which myth can depict in epic color.

Omniversal Media’s broad canvas (the term Omniversal itself) suggests storytelling on a cosmic scale, potentially encompassing multiple universes or dimensions. Hawkins’ theory assures that all those dimensions are connected through consciousness. If the story involves different planes (physical world, spiritual realms, dream worlds), Hawkins’ framework legitimizes that multiplicity: e.g., multiple heavens aligned with levels of consciousness  could translate into fictional settings of varying vibrational quality. A character might literally travel to a higher plane by raising their consciousness, mirroring shamanic journeys or ascensions found in mythology.

Furthermore, Hawkins’ inclusion of figures like archangels and avatars at the top of the scale  means that mythic archetypes already live in his system. An Omniversal story could easily incorporate angels, demons, gods, and enlightened sages as part of its narrative universe – Hawkins has essentially placed them on the map. For example, an avatar (like a Jesus or Buddha figure in the story’s lore) would calibrate at 1000 and serve as a guiding light. Lower entities (like perhaps a deceiving demiurge or tyrant figure) would calibrate very low, and in Hawkins’ terms would eventually collapse under the weight of their falsehood (since only truth prevails). This dynamic – the ultimate triumph of high-consciousness over low-consciousness – is deeply mythic, resonating with the classic trope that “light conquers darkness”. Hawkins even quantified this: one saint outweighs millions of sinners energetically . So in a story, one enlightened hero could turn the tide against a vast empire of ignorance, which is exactly the stuff of epic myth.

Reincarnation Cycles and Soul Missions

The hashtag #Reincarnated2Resist plainly indicates that reincarnation is central to the narrative – and not just reincarnation for its own sake, but reincarnation with a purpose (to resist). Hawkins’ theory strongly affirms the reality of reincarnation and the idea of purposeful rebirth. By calibrating reincarnation as true  and describing birth circumstances as “karmically perfect” , Hawkins provides a philosophical backbone for reincarnation-based storytelling. Each lifetime in the story can be seen as another step on the Map of Consciousness for the character(s). Perhaps a hero is reborn multiple times, each time overcoming certain challenges or oppressive forces, each time growing stronger in awareness – this aligns with Hawkins’ view that the soul (or consciousness) retains its level and keeps evolving. If a character died at, say, level 300 (willingness), they might reincarnate and continue upward from that point, eventually reaching levels of love or enlightenment after many trials. This is reminiscent of the concept of the Bodhisattva – one who reincarnates deliberately to help liberate others. In Hawkins’ calibrations, selfless spiritual teachers (like Ramana Maharshi at 720 ) and even certain statements about service calibrated extremely high, reflecting the nobility of such sacrifice.

“Reincarnated to Resist” also implies a cyclic struggle, possibly against the same recurring adversary or systemic evil that spans lifetimes. Hawkins’ framework can support that too. The “systemic illusion or control” that the hero resists could be metaphorically represented by the lower attractor fields that keep humanity in bondage. For instance, one could portray a literal matrix of Fear and Greed that enslaves people (akin to the Matrix movies’ concept, but here those are actual energy fields in Hawkins’ terms). The hero, life after life, might break people free from those fields – essentially raising them above level 200. In a sense, Hawkins saw his work as doing just that: “to free people from the lower levels by exposing the truth”. He explicitly said that at lower levels people are “prone to be manipulated” , so a liberator would aim to empower them (give them Courage and Love, metaphorically). In the mythos, this could be dramatized as freeing minds from propaganda, or literally slaying creatures that feed on fear, etc. The concrete details depend on the creative flavor (sci-fi, fantasy, spiritual allegory), but the underlying theme of liberation through consciousness is common to both Hawkins and #Reincarnated2Resist.

We also see Hawkins assign destiny roles via calibration – e.g., calibrating a historical person’s level implies a sort of destiny. In a story, characters could be aware of their level or mission. Perhaps an order of wise beings (similar to Jedi or ascended masters) monitors the calibration of the world and decides when a soul must reincarnate to “balance” something. Interestingly, Hawkins claimed that when humanity was in peril (below 200), higher beings incarnated to help – e.g., the surge above 200 in the 1980s might be attributed to an influx of more conscious individuals. In mythic terms, that’s like saying the heroes have arrived just in time. #Reincarnated2Resist could literally embody that idea with protagonists who were present at previous “ends of the world” and have come again.

Resistance to Systemic Illusion and Control

One of the most powerful intersections of Hawkins’ theory and the Omniversal Media mythos is the notion of resisting illusion, deception, and control systems. Hawkins’ entire project is about discerning Truth vs. Falsehood, the title of one of his books. He would calibrate institutions, doctrines, and even media outlets to see which were integrous and which were misleading. For example, he found certain totalitarian ideologies or terrorist movements calibrated extremely low (in the single digits or teens)  , indicating pure destructive falsehood. He found that propaganda and lies literally weaken the human spirit, as shown in muscle tests  . Thus, Hawkins provides a moral imperative to resist lies – not just because lies are unethical, but because they spiritually weaken and enslave people. This dovetails perfectly with a narrative about fighting an evil empire or a false Matrix.

Consider how Hawkins described sub-200 states: at Anger (150), one is easily provoked and can be used by hate; at Fear (100), one is controllable through threats; at Apathy (50), one is inert and conquered by hopelessness. A system that wants to control a population would try to keep them at those levels – a strategy tyrants use in real life via fear-mongering or disempowerment. In Hawkins’ language, that is literally a strategy to lower collective consciousness so that people can’t resist. Now, #Reincarnated2Resist seems to be all about breaking that pattern – reincarnating specifically to fight those who impose fear, apathy, shame, etc., on society (whether it’s an allegorical “Dark Lord” or real-world corrupt institutions). Hawkins would concur that the true battle is energetic: to pull people up from those low frequencies to at least Courage (200) where they can stand in truth. He said “the level of Courage is the point at which we begin to discern truth from falsehood and essence from ego” . So the first act of resistance is to raise awareness to courage – get people to see through the lies, to no longer be shamed or scared into submission. This is precisely the goal of many awakening narratives and fits with content titles like “Standing Your Ground” or “Breaking The Matrix” on Omniversal Media.

In the mythic context, we might imagine a dramatic representation: perhaps an antagonist spreads a “Veil of Illusion” that keeps humanity asleep (symbolizing the low levels). The hero’s task, incarnation after incarnation, is to tear that veil, often at great personal cost. This struggle could be cast in terms of information (e.g. a truth-teller reborn in different eras to expose whatever lies the rulers are telling) – we note the project’s site mentions being “shadow banned”, implying they deal with suppressed truths. Hawkins’ method of truth-testing every statement in the world is like a superpower in such a story! It’s easy to see a character inspired by Hawkins, who can intuitively sense the truth-value of any statement or detect negativity in any environment. Such an ability would be invaluable to resist an all-encompassing deception. Perhaps the #Reincarnated2Resist hero possesses this kind of “truth sense,” allowing them to navigate a world of propaganda.

Additionally, Hawkins spoke of “calibrating the consciousness of entire cities, countries, and eras”. For example, he gave average levels for nations and noted how they fluctuate  . This macro perspective is akin to a storyline where the “consciousness grid” of Earth is monitored or fought over. Science fiction often has concepts of global consciousness or noospheres – Hawkins provided one, saying the planet’s consciousness can be measured and has tipping points. In an Omniversal Media narrative, one might have a climax where the collective frequency must be raised above a threshold (like 200) to avert doom – exactly what Hawkins suggests happened in the 1980s . The heroes might succeed in rallying humanity’s courage, thus foiling the villain’s plan to keep the world in fear. This is essentially a mythologized retelling of Hawkins’ data.

Alignment of Scientific-Spiritual Vision

Omniversal Media, by its branding, likely embraces both technological/scientific themes and spiritual themes (the term Media suggests a modern platform, while Omniversal suggests cosmic scope). Hawkins’ theory, being a blend of the scientific (kinesiology, energy fields) and the spiritual (enlightenment, karma), provides a unifying vision that speaks to both science and myth.

For instance, in a story context, one could use the language of quantum fields and resonance (from HOT or Hawkins) to explain magical or miraculous events. A miracle could be framed as a high-frequency field effect that science doesn’t yet understand but is real. The idea of resonance is key in HOT  and implicitly in Hawkins (harmonizing with truth vs dissonance of falsehood). #Reincarnated2Resist might incorporate music (the mention of a rapper “Hawk Eye” and multimedia content). If so, Hawkins’ notion that a lot of modern music calibrates below 200  while some music can uplift is interesting – the narrative could use art and music as a battleground of consciousness. Perhaps Omniversal Media sees creative expression as a way to raise consciousness (hence “media” in the name). Hawkins would agree: he calibrated genuine art and found it can transmit higher vibrations.

There is also a synchrony in the language of both. The mythos tagline includes “Resist”, suggesting opposition to some controlling force. Hawkins would identify that force not as a particular group of people (he warned against contempt or hate, which themselves are low), but as the impersonal force of Falsehood or Negativity that can work through people. In a myth, that could be depicted as a dark entity or an AI overlord or just the chaos of ignorance. Either way, Hawkins arms the resisters with a clear principle: only by embodying truth (love, courage, unity) can you defeat falsehood. Force (coercion, violence born of anger) won’t succeed because it’s on the enemy’s level. This is a classic spiritual teaching – “you can’t fight darkness with more darkness; you need light.” Hawkins provided evidence for it: anything done below 200 only creates more weakness. So the hero must avoid the temptation of hate and instead use the Power of integrity and compassion to win. This moral theme could be a central conflict in #Reincarnated2Resist: Will the protagonist fight the empire with the same aggression and fall to 150 (Anger)? Or will they find the higher path at 500 (Love) and transform the situation? Hawkins’ map basically says the latter is the true victory mode .

The Omniverse and Personal Mythos

Finally, both Hawkins’ theory and the Omniversal Media mythos share a grand, integrative scope. Hawkins did not limit himself to any one tradition or discipline – he drew from all religions, all sciences, all cultures (calibrating the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, teachings of Lao Tzu, etc. on one scale  ). This syncretism is “omniversal” in spirit. Omniversal Media likewise sounds like a platform that wants to bridge multiple perspectives and mediums to tell one big story.

In a personal mythos like #Reincarnated2Resist, the creator is effectively placing themselves as a character in a myth that overlaps with reality – using narrative to interpret real struggles (like censorship, truth-seeking, social justice) in a legendary framework. Hawkins’ work, while presented in sober tones, is inherently mythic as well – it speaks of calibrating the truth of history, understanding the hidden forces behind events, and the eventual triumph of consciousness. One could say Hawkins provided a myth of consciousness for the modern age, where kinesiological testers are like oracles, calibrations are like pronouncements of a cosmic justice, and the Map is a ladder to heaven. It may not be a conventional myth with characters, but it sets the stage for countless myths to be woven on top of it.

To illustrate, Hawkins often noted that certain figures changed the world’s course by their mere presence at high levels (the “power of the few individuals at the top” ). This is akin to the myth of the messiah or culture hero who prevents catastrophe. In Hawkins’ data, the appearance of a 600 or 700-level being can counterbalance negativity that would have led to war or collapse . Now imagine a story where each time the world is on the brink, a hero reincarnates at a high level to tip the scales – that’s essentially Hawkins’ narrative in dramatic form. #Reincarnated2Resist might very well be telling that story: “the end was set, we all were there before… and nothing stopped the Beginning where we all met” (as quoted on the Omniversal site ). This poetic line suggests a group of souls witnessing creation and coming back whenever needed – which fits Hawkins’ cyclic view of cosmic ages and the role of avatars.

In conclusion, David R. Hawkins’ Omniversal theory and the Omniversal Media mythos enrich each other. Hawkins provides the conceptual scaffold and spiritual verification for the mythos’ themes of reincarnation, cosmic struggle, and awakening from illusion. His core principles – a unified consciousness field, levels of awareness, and the idea that Truth is power – give intellectual and esoteric depth to the creative narrative. Conversely, the mythos provides a vivid, engaging way to personify and dramatize Hawkins’ abstract ideas, making them accessible and emotionally resonant. Both are ultimately aligned in a hopeful message: that through raising consciousness (individually and collectively), one can transcend the forces of fear and control, and perhaps transform the entire Omniverse in the process.

Conclusion

David R. Hawkins’ work stands as a bold attempt to chart the unseen realms of consciousness and tie together the scientific and spiritual understanding of reality. His so-called Omniversal theory posits a living universe of many levels, all unified by the substrate of consciousness and governed by the polarity of truth vs falsehood. Such a worldview naturally complements creative visions like Omniversal Media’s #Reincarnated2Resist, which echoes these themes in narrative form – depicting souls who reincarnate across time and space to fight deception and ignite awakening. Both Hawkins and the Omniversal mythos invite us to see our lives as part of a much larger, meaningful tapestry: a grand struggle of enlightenment against ignorance, played out on both inner and outer planes. By synchronizing Hawkins’ principles with mythopoeic storytelling, one crafts a powerful synergy of idea and imagination – a conceptual map and a mythic territory reflecting one another. In practical terms, this fusion can inspire individuals to view personal growth (raising one’s consciousness) as a heroic act of resistance in a world that often profits from keeping people asleep. It also frames the challenges of our era – information overload, ideological division, cynicism – as fundamentally spiritual challenges that require a leap in awareness.

In the end, Hawkins’ Omniversal theory and the #Reincarnated2Resist narrative both convey a profound truth: the real battleground is consciousness itself. By mastering that inner realm – by calibrating our own being toward courage, love, and ultimately enlightenment – we each become protagonists in the cosmic story, capable of transforming reality. This alignment of theory and myth not only enriches the creative world of Omniversal Media but also serves as a reminder that we are all, in a sense, “reincarnated to resist” the ignorance of our age and to midwife the next level of collective consciousness. As Hawkins might say, everything is here and now – the entire Omniverse of potential is present within us  – and by choosing truth and higher awareness, we participate in the ongoing evolution of that Omniverse toward its highest expression.
