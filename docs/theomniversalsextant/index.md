## 🧬 Purpose

This repository anchors the initial transmissions, diagrams, and methodologies of **The Omniversal Sextant**—a tool not just for orientation, but for activation.

It is to be revisited regularly, upgraded as transmissions refine, and may eventually seed new frameworks for:

- 🌀 Mythic cartography  
- 🛠️ Infrastructure templating  
- 🌱 Rebuilding Roots field activation

> “The Sextant doesn’t tell you where to go.  
> It reveals where you’ve always been headed.”
